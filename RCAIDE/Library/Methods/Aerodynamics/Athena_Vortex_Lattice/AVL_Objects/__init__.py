"""
AVL data structures and object definitions for aircraft geometry and analysis configuration.

This module provides the set of data structures required for AVL 
(Athena Vortex Lattice) analysis including aircraft geometry representation, 
analysis case definitions, and result containers. The objects handle translation 
between RCAIDE and AVL formats while maintaining geometric fidelity and 
aerodynamic accuracy.
