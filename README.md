[RCAIDE: Research Community Aircraft Interdisciplinary Design Environment]([link](https://www.rcaide.leadsresearchgroup.com/))
=======

The Research Community Aircraft Interdisciplinary Design Environment, or RCAIDE  (pronounced ‚Äúarcade‚Äù) is a powerful open-source Python platform that revolutionizes aircraft design and analysis. From commercial airliners to UAVs and next-generation hybrid-electric aircraft, RCAIDE provides comprehensive multi-disciplinary analysis tools backed by validated engineering methods. Our streamlined workflow and modular architecture help aerospace engineers and researchers accelerate development cycles and explore innovative designs with confidence. RCAIDE-LEADS is a form from RCAIDE, developed and maintained by the [Lab for Electric Aircraft Design and Sustainability](https://www.leadsresearchgroup.com/)
 
## Transinitign from SUAVE Legacy 
RCAIDE was built to allow users to transition their work to smoothly from SUAVE to RCAIDE. The organization of RCAIDE‚Äôs code structure was done such that a SUAVE user can understand it, but breaks free of some of the antiquated nomenclature. To maintain backwards compatibility for the first release, a frozen version of SUAVE is packaged as a library. This enables users to access the deprecated SUAVE features as RCAIDE‚Äôs abilities grow.
 
## Code Architecture 
The code is arranged into repositories that house native data structures, functions, components, and subroutines for discipline analyses and support number-crunching operations. This allows for intuitive navigation by developers or avid users seeking to modify the source code. Solely written in Python, an RCAIDE installation
appears in one repository that is itself organized into two secondary-level repositories: 
* **RCAIDE** sub-directory, where their source code resides
* **Regressions** sub-directory, where unit tests for verification and validation are performed.

```
The RCAIDE subdirectory is arranged into frameworks and methods modules. Its predecessor, SUAVE, was written primarily as a superseding framework. Think of framework modules as the glue or roadmap that connects all the functions housed in the Library folder. The framework folder mainly comprises core data structures, classes instances of the various methods within the code, the mission and energy networks and the optimization framework. The Library module comprises five tertiary submodules: Attributes, Components,  Methods, Mission and Plots.

## Capabilities of RCAIDE
RCAIDE currently possesses the ability to perform the following analyses, each at varying levels of fidelity. Here, we define fidelity as a level of accuracy to the actual physical value. As the level of fidelity increases, so does accuracy. However, this comes with the penalty of computational time and memory.  Having multi-fidelity capability allows RCAIDE to perform energy network analysis, complete flight  vehicle mission analysis, multi-fidelity optimization, design space exploration, artificial intelligence, and model-based systems engineering. Here are some notable use cases of RCAIDE: 
 (link to tutorials)

* Mission Analysis   
* Optimization 
    * Gradient-based optimization
    * Non-gradient-based optimization
    * Multi-fidelity optimization
* Performance Analysis
    * Payload range 
    * Aerodynamic analysis
    * V-N diagrams
    * Propeller analysis 
    * Takeoff Field Length Estimation
* Weights Analysis
    * Operating Empty Weight, Zero Fuel Weight estimation
    * Component weight estimation 
    * Center of Gravity estimation
    * Moment of Intertia estimation 

  

## Installing RCAIDE
